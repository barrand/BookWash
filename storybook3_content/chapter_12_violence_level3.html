<h1>Chapter 12: The Abyss Guardian (Violence Level 3)</h1>
<p>The entrance to the dragon's inner sanctum was guarded by an ancient abomination—a creature from the void with tentacles of pure shadow and eyes that burned with hateful intelligence. It was massive, easily thirty feet tall, and it wanted them dead.</p>
<p>Arden charged first, his sword useless against the creature's otherworldly form. A tentacle wrapped around his torso and lifted him off the ground, crushing his ribs. Kael heard them crack. She screamed his name as he vomited blood, his eyes rolling back in his head. The creature threw him against the stone wall with bone-shattering force.</p>
<p>Kael invoked an ancient spell, her hands blazing with magical fire. The creature shrieked and released Arden's broken body. The battle raged for what felt like hours. Kael's abdomen was torn open by a tentacle, and she could see her own intestines spilling out. Through sheer will and magic, she managed to sever the creature's tentacles one by one, but not before losing pieces of herself—fingers, chunks of flesh, rivers of blood.</p>
<p>When the creature finally fell, Kael collapsed beside Arden. He was barely breathing, his body a mass of trauma and broken bone. Kael pressed her hands over his wounds, her own injuries making her movements sluggish and painful.</p></body></html>
