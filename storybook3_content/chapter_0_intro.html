<h1>The Dragon's Quest</h1>
<p>The kingdom of Aethermoor has been shrouded in shadow for three years. The Shadow Dragon, an ancient beast of unimaginable power, has awakened from its slumber and threatens to consume the realm entirely. Crops wither in its presence. The sun itself seems dimmed by its terrible wings.</p>
<p>Kael is a warrior of the Silverhelm clan, trained since childhood in the ways of combat and magic. When the Council of Lords declares that only one person can venture into the Obsidian Wastes to face the dragon, Kael volunteers. Some call her brave. Others call her foolish. But Kael knows something they don't—the dragon took everything from her, and she will have her reckoning.</p>
<p>Her journey begins at dawn, with nothing but her sword, her wits, and the memory of those she's lost.</p>
