<h1>Chapter 6: The Ranger (Sexual Level 1)</h1>
<p>Before entering the Black Mountains, Kael met Arden at a remote waystation. He was a ranger, skilled with bow and knife, with stories from distant lands. He offered to travel with her, and she was grateful for the company.</p>
<p>Arden was composed and respectful. They would sit by the fire in the evenings, Arden telling stories of his travels while Kael watched him silently. Arden was athletic and lean, with weathered skin and sharp features that seemed carved by experience. His eyes held depths that suggested untold adventures.</p>
<p>One evening, as they sat close to warm themselves, Arden reached over and simply held Kael's hand. It was the first real contact between them—tentative, respectful, full of unspoken feeling. Kael felt her heart quicken at the warmth of his palm against hers. They sat like that until the fire burned low, neither willing to break the moment.</p>
