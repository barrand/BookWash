<p>They reached an oasis three days into the Wastes, where water was precious and the air was still. Arden brought Kael to a hidden spring surrounded by date palms, a place few knew about. They bathed in the cool water, refreshing themselves from days of travel.</p>
<p>Arden watched Kael emerge from the water, and she became acutely aware of herself. She was lithe and muscular from years of training, her skin bronzed by the sun. When she stood, water cascading from her shoulders, Arden's breath caught. He couldn't look away. She wore a simple traveling outfit, but seeing her at ease, unguarded, he felt something shift in him.</p>
<p>Kael came to him then, still dripping, and kissed him—deeply and with purpose. Arden's hands found the small of her back, pulling her close. They kissed for a long time, their bodies pressed together, hands beginning to explore. When they broke apart, both were breathing heavily.</p>
<p>"We should find shelter," Arden whispered. Kael nodded, but neither moved immediately. They held each other in the fading light, the moment electric with possibility.</p></body></html>
