<h1>Chapter 13: The Dragon's Wrath (Violence Level 4)</h1>
<p>The Shadow Dragon emerged fully from its chamber, a mountain of scales and malice. It breathed fire that melted stone, and when its claws struck, they carved through flesh and bone as if they were parchment. Kael watched in horror as the dragon took Arden's left arm off at the shoulder, the limb flying across the chamber and landing near Kael's feet, blood still spurting from the stump.</p>
<p>Arden's screams were inhuman, a sound of agony beyond description. The dragon, amused by his suffering, began to systematically dismantle him. It severed his right leg, then his other arm, leaving him a bleeding torso and head, still miraculously alive and conscious, forced to watch his own annihilation.</p>
<p>"KAEL!" he screamed, a final plea for mercy that the dragon would not grant. The beast reached down and crushed Arden's skull beneath one massive claw, brain and blood painting the stone floor. His body convulsed once and went still.</p>
<p>Kael felt something break inside her, something beyond grief or rage. The dragon turned its attention to her, licking blood from its fangs. "Your turn, little warrior," it rumbled. Kael stood, despite her wounds, despite the horror, ready for her final stand.</p></body></html>
