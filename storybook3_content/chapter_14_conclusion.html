<h1>Epilogue: Five Years Later</h1>
<p>Kael sits in the new palace gardens, her body a road map of scars and loss. Her left eye is missing, replaced by a gemstone prosthetic that glows faintly at night. The dragon did not die easily, and neither did she. But in the end, she drove her sword through its heart and brought down an ancient evil.</p>
<p>The kingdom mourns Arden and the countless others who fell. Memorials have been erected, songs have been sung. Kael never married, never loved again. When people ask her why, she simply touches the scar along her jaw—the dragon's last gift—and says nothing.</p>
<p>Yet sometimes, on quiet mornings in the garden, she remembers the way he held her hand by the fire. The taste of him. The promises they made in the temple, knowing they might not come true. The dragon may have taken everything from her, but it could not take those memories.</p>
<p>Kael has become what she set out to be: a legend. The realm is safe. And that, she tells herself, is enough. It has to be.</p></body></html>
