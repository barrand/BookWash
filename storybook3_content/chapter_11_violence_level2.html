<h1>Chapter 11: The Drake Swarm (Violence Level 2)</h1>
<p>Dozens of shadow drakes descended upon them, larger and more vicious than the servants before. Kael and Arden fought back-to-back, their swords swinging in desperate arcs. A drake's claws raked across Arden's shoulder, leaving deep gouges that bled freely. He cried out in pain but didn't stop fighting.</p>
<p>A drake's teeth found Kael's thigh, tearing a chunk of flesh before she could react. She screamed and drove her sword through the creature's skull, dark ichor spraying across her face. The fighting was brutal and unforgiving. Bodies—both creature and human—littered the ground around them.</p>
<p>By the time the last drake fell, both warriors were badly wounded. Arden's shoulder hung limp, blood soaking his shirt. Kael's leg burned with fire, the wound deep and serious. "We need to rest," Kael gasped, but they both knew they didn't have the luxury of time.</p></body></html>
