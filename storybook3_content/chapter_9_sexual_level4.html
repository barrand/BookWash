<h1>Chapter 9: The Final Night (Sexual Level 4)</h1>
<p>The night before they reached the dragon's lair, Arden made love to Kael with an urgency born of knowing it might be their last chance. She wore the silk robe she'd kept hidden—deep crimson with gold embroidery, barely covering her curves. Through the thin fabric, he could see the outline of her breasts, their dark peaks visible, her hips flaring beautifully below her narrow waist.</p>
<p>He slipped the robe from her shoulders, revealing her completely. Her body was perfect in its imperfection—breasts heavy and responsive to his touch, her skin flushed and glistening with desire. When he entered her, she wrapped her legs around him, pulling him deeper inside her.</p>
<p>"Harder," she gasped, and he obliged, thrusting with intensity that made her breasts bounce with each movement. She was wet and tight, and the sensation drove him mad. He flipped her over, taking her from behind, her moans filling the night air as he pounded into her relentlessly.</p>
<p>They came together violently, her inner muscles clenching around him as waves of pleasure consumed her body. He emptied himself into her with a cry, and they collapsed together, sweating and trembling, knowing this might be all they'd ever have.</p></body></html>
