<p>They found an abandoned temple, its stone walls still beautiful despite centuries of neglect. Arden spread his cloak on the floor, and Kael slowly removed her armor piece by piece. Beneath, she wore the fighting leathers of her order—form-fitting and revealing. Her breasts were full and high, her waist narrow, her stomach flat and marked with scars from past battles.</p>

<p>Arden removed his own clothes, and they stood together in the pale moonlight filtering through the temple's high windows. His body was hard and scarred like hers, a map of survival. When he touched her breast, she gasped. His fingers traced the curve of her body as she reached for him, stroking the hard length of him between her thighs.</p>
<p>They moved together slowly at first, then with increasing urgency. Kael straddled him, her body moving against his with a rhythm that built tension between them. The sensation was intense and overwhelming, and when she came, she called out his name.</p></body></html>
