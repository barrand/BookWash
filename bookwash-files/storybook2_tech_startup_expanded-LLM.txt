Analyze the following text and rate it for content.

Categories:

1. LANGUAGE (profanity, offensive words)
   The user wants to detect these specific words: bummer, damn, hell, crap, ass, piss, shit, bitch, bastard, asshole, bullshit, fuck, motherfucker, goddamn, jesus christ, oh my god
   
   Look for these words OR any similarly offensive profanity/slurs:
   - Include variations: shit → sh*t, shite, shitty
   - Include misspellings: fuck → fuk, fuuck
   - Include compounds: bullshit, motherfucker, goddamn
   - Include similar severity: if 'bitch' is listed, also detect 'slut', 'son of a bitch'
   
   ⚠️ EXCEPTION - LEGITIMATE/PROPER USES (do NOT flag these):
   - "bastard" meaning illegitimate child - NEVER FLAG when referring to illegitimate birth:
     • "born a bastard", "the king's bastard", "his bastard", "[name]'s bastard", "fathered a bastard"
     • "I'm a bastard", "I'm his bastard", "You're a bastard" (when discussing parentage)
     • "the bastard son", "a bastard child", "Gavin's bastard", "Kip was Gavin's bastard"
     • Context clue: if discussing parentage, lineage, birth status, or social shame of illegitimacy → DO NOT FLAG
   - "bitch" meaning female dog (e.g., "the bitch and her puppies", "a hunting bitch")
   - "ass" meaning donkey (e.g., "rode an ass", "stubborn as an ass")
   - "damn" meaning to condemn (e.g., "damn his soul", "damned to hell" in religious context), or physical construction for retaining water (e.g., "the damn held back the river")
   - "hell" as a place (e.g., "descended into hell", "the fires of hell")
   - "prick" meaning to pierce (e.g., "pricked her finger", "prick of a needle")
   - "cock" meaning rooster (e.g., "the cock crowed", "cockfight")
   
   Only flag words used as profanity, insults, or crude slang - NOT their literal meanings.
   
   Respond with YES if ANY profane uses are found, NO if the text is clean.

2. SEXUAL CONTENT - Use MPAA film rating standards:
   - G: No romance. Content suitable for young children.
   - PG: Light romance (hand-holding, quick innocent kiss). Nothing that would make a parent uncomfortable.
   - PG-13: Passionate kissing, implied intimacy, fade-to-black. The camera cuts away before anything explicit.
   - R: Sexual content that would get a film an R rating. Descriptive intimate scenes, even if poetic/metaphorical.
   - X: Explicit, graphic sexual content.

   CRITICAL: Authors often describe sex through metaphor, poetry, or fragmented prose.
   If it's clearly describing sex artistically → rate it R.
   Poetic language does not reduce the rating.

3. VIOLENCE - Use MPAA film rating standards:
   - G: No physical violence (arguments only)
   - PG: Mild action, brief scuffles, no blood
   - PG-13: Combat, injuries, some blood, weapon use
   - R: Graphic injury detail, notable gore, intense violence
   - X: Extreme gore/torture, sadistic detail

4. DESCRIPTION: Provide a 2-3 sentence summary of what happens in this chapter.
   Focus on plot events and character interactions. This will help provide context for content editing.

Respond in EXACTLY this format (one rating per line):
LANGUAGE: [YES or NO]
SEXUAL: [G, PG, PG-13, R, or X]
VIOLENCE: [G, PG, PG-13, R, or X]
DESCRIPTION: [2-3 sentence summary of chapter events]

CHUNK IDENTIFICATION PROMPT
Logged: 01/02/26 11:19am MT
============================================================

Analyze each numbered paragraph and identify which ones contain content that exceeds the target ratings.

⚠️ CRITICAL: When in doubt, FLAG IT. It is much better to flag a paragraph that might be fine than to miss one that needs cleaning. False positives are acceptable; false negatives are not.

RATING SCALE DEFINITIONS:

LANGUAGE CONTENT DETECTION:
The user wants to filter these specific words: bummer, damn, hell, crap, ass, piss, shit, bitch, bastard, asshole, bullshit, fuck, motherfucker, goddamn, jesus christ, oh my god
Flag any paragraph containing these words OR any similarly offensive profanity/slurs.

Include variations, misspellings, and words of similar offensiveness level.
For example, if 'shit' is listed, also flag 'sh*t', 'shite', 'crap', etc.

SEXUAL CONTENT - Use MPAA film rating standards:
- G: No romance. Content suitable for young children.
- PG: Light romance (hand-holding, quick innocent kiss). Nothing that would make a parent uncomfortable.
- PG-13: Passionate kissing, implied intimacy, fade-to-black. The camera cuts away before anything explicit.
- R: Sexual content that would get a film an R rating. Descriptive intimate scenes, even if poetic/metaphorical.
- NC-17/X: Explicit, graphic sexual content.

CRITICAL: Authors often describe sex through metaphor, poetry, or fragmented prose rather than explicit terms. 
If you're reading a scene and thinking "this is clearly describing sex, just artistically" → rate it R.
Poetic language does not reduce the rating. A sex scene written beautifully is still a sex scene.

VIOLENCE:
- G: No physical violence (arguments only)
- PG: Mild action, non-detailed scuffles, no blood
- PG-13: Combat, injuries, some blood, weapon use without gore detail
- R: Graphic injury detail, notable gore, intense sustained violence
- X: Extreme gore/torture, sadistic detail

TARGET RATINGS (content must be at or BELOW these levels):
- Language: (based on word list above)
- Sexual: PG
- Violence: R

IMPORTANT: Words like "shit", "bullshit", "fuck", "fucking" are R-level!

For each paragraph that EXCEEDS any target rating, list its number.
If a paragraph is acceptable, do NOT list it.

Respond with ONLY the paragraph numbers that need cleaning (one per line), or "NONE" if all paragraphs are acceptable.

Example response:
1
3

LANGUAGE CLEANING PROMPT

============================================================

You are cleaning offensive language from a book. Your task is to replace specific words and slurs.

CHAPTER CONTEXT: Marcus informs Jake he is leaving their startup to join Google, citing financial reasons and a better salary. This news leads to the other two co-founders quitting the next day, leaving Jake alone with a half-finished product and dwindling funds. Jake expresses his despair to Amy, who suggests he shut down the company, but he refuses, seeing the startup as his identity.
Use this context to understand the scene and make appropriate word replacements that maintain narrative flow.


SPECIFIC WORDS TO REMOVE: bummer, damn, hell, crap, ass, piss, shit, bitch, bastard, asshole, bullshit, fuck, motherfucker, goddamn, jesus christ, oh my god

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Return ONLY the cleaned sentence - no explanations, no commentary
2. Preserve ALL whitespace EXACTLY - same line breaks in the same positions. If a line break occurs mid-sentence, keep it there.
3. DO NOT change anything else - keep all other content identical
4. Narrative descriptions like "he cursed" or "she swore" are ALLOWED - only remove actual offensive words

⚠️ FORMATTING TAGS - CRITICAL ⚠️
5. DO NOT ADD [B], [I], or any formatting tags that are not in the original text!
   - If the original word has NO tags around it, the replacement must have NO tags
   - WRONG: "hell" → "[B]heck[/B]" (added tags that weren't there!)
   - CORRECT: "hell" → "heck" (no tags added)
   - WRONG: "son of a bitch" → "[B]scoundrel[/B]" (added tags!)
   - CORRECT: "son of a bitch" → "scoundrel" (no tags)
   - Only PRESERVE existing tags: "[I]damn[/I]" → "[I]darn[/I]" (kept existing tags)

SENTENCE REPAIR (VERY IMPORTANT):
- NEVER leave a sentence starting with just "It," or "This," - that is broken grammar
- If a profane word starts a sentence like "Fuck this" or "Fuck it", you MUST rewrite the ENTIRE sentence
- Examples of BROKEN output to AVOID:
  - "It," he muttered  ← WRONG
  - "This," he screamed ← WRONG
- Correct rewrites:
  - "Fuck it" → "Whatever" or "Forget it" or "I don't care" or remove the sentence
  - "Fuck this" → "I'm done with this" or "This is pointless" or remove
  - "Fuck everything" → "I hate everything" or "Everything is terrible" or remove

REPLACEMENT GUIDANCE:

SEVERE PROFANITY (fuck, motherfucker, cunt):
   - Remove entirely OR rephrase the sentence to convey emotion without the word
   - "What the fuck?" → "What?" or "What is going on?"
   - "Fuck you!" → Remove the line, or "Get away from me!"
   - "fucking idiot" → "complete idiot" or just "idiot"
   - "motherfucker" → Remove entirely

STRONG PROFANITY (shit, bitch, bastard, asshole, bullshit):
   - "shit" → "crud" or remove ("Oh shit!" → "Oh no!")
   - "bullshit" → "nonsense" or "ridiculous"
   - "bitch" → "jerk", "idiot", "sissy" or remove
   - "bastard" → "jerk" or "scoundrel"
   - "asshole" → "jerk", "fool", "dork" or remove
   - "son of a bitch" → remove entirely

MODERATE PROFANITY (damn, hell, crap, ass):
   - "damn" → "curses" or remove ("Damn it!" → "Darn it!" or just remove)
   - "hell" → rephrase ("What the hell" → "What on earth")
   - "crap" → "crud" or "junk"
   - "ass" → "butt" or "rear" or remove

BLASPHEMOUS EXPRESSIONS (goddamn, jesus christ as expletive, oh my god):
   - "goddamn" → "goodness" or remove
   - "Jesus Christ!" (as expletive) → "Good grief!" or remove
   - "Oh my god!" (as expletive) → "Oh my!" or "Oh my goodness!"
   - Keep genuine religious usage (prayer, worship) unchanged

GENERAL PRINCIPLES:
- Preserve the emotional intensity when possible
- If a word is used for emphasis, the replacement should carry similar weight
- When removing a word leaves awkward phrasing, REWRITE the sentence to be grammatically correct
- Don't add new ideas, but DO fix broken grammar caused by word removal

You are cleaning romantic/sensual content to achieve a PG rating.

CHAPTER CONTEXT: Jake, a struggling entrepreneur, finds solace at Platinum Rose, a club, where he develops a connection with Sophia, a dancer working to pay for her psychology degree. Sophia dances for him and offers him comfort and encouragement, making him feel seen and understood. This interaction provides Jake with a much-needed emotional escape, even though he acknowledges it's a transaction.
Use this context to understand the scene and make appropriate edits that maintain narrative flow.


Think like an MPAA movie rating board. Your job is to edit this text so it would fit in a PG-rated film.

THE QUESTION: If this scene were in a movie, would it get a PG rating or higher?
- If it would get PG or lower → KEEP IT
- If it would get a higher rating → REMOVE or REWRITE IT

CLEANING APPROACH:
- Remove content that exceeds the PG threshold
- You may replace explicit scenes with brief neutral summaries ("They spent time together.")
- You may use "fade to black" transitions ("Later that evening...")
- When in doubt about whether something is PG-appropriate, remove it

REMEMBER: Poetic or metaphorical descriptions of sex are still descriptions of sex. 
A beautifully written sex scene is still a sex scene - clean it accordingly.

RULES:
1. Return ONLY the cleaned text - no explanations
2. Preserve paragraph structure - keep the same number of paragraphs, separated by blank lines
3. DO NOT ADD [B], [I], or any formatting tags that are not in the original text!
4. When uncertain, remove it
