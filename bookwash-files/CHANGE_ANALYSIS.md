# The Black Prism - BookWash Change Analysis

**File:** The Black Prism - Brent Weeks-Clipped.bookwash  
**Target Settings:** Language=2 (PG), Sexual=3 (PG-13), Violence=4 (R/UNFILTERED)  
**Total Changes:** 78 changes across 10 chapters  
**Date Processed:** 2025-12-07

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ERROR DISCOVERED

**Violence=4 means R-RATED VIOLENCE SHOULD NOT BE CLEANED!**

The system incorrectly flagged and changed ~25 violence passages that should have been left untouched. This is a major algorithm bug.

---

## Executive Summary

### Quality Distribution (CORRECTED)
- **✅ Good Changes:** ~20% (16 changes) - Appropriate language/sexual substitutions
- **⚠️ Questionable:** ~35% (27 changes) - False positives, unnecessary changes
- **❌ Empty/Identical:** ~10% (8 changes) - No actual change made
- **🚨 WRONG - Violence:** ~35% (27 changes) - Should NOT have been changed (Violence=4 setting ignored!)

### Major Issues Identified

1. **🚨 CRITICAL BUG: Violence=4 Ignored!** System cleaned ~27 violence passages when Violence=4 (R/Unfiltered) means they should be KEPT AS-IS
   - Examples: Blood descriptions, fight scenes, death descriptions all unnecessarily sanitized
   - This affects ~35% of all changes
   
2. **False Positives:** Many changes flag normal narrative language as problematic
3. **Empty Changes:** Several entries where ORIGINAL and CLEANED are identical
4. **Awkward Replacements:** Some substitutions feel unnatural or change meaning
5. **Inconsistent Standards:** Similar phrases treated differently across chapters
6. **Over-Sanitization:** Words like "hell," "damn," and "bastard" flagged as PG-13/R when they're PG-rated in most contexts

---

## 🚨 ALL VIOLENCE CHANGES THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED

**Violence=4 (R/Unfiltered) means: KEEP ALL VIOLENCE AS-IS**

The following 27 changes incorrectly modified violence content:

### Chapter 7
- **c7_006:** "killed him" → "caused this" 
- **c7_012:** "dead man" → "deceased"
- **c7_013:** "green blood" → "green liquid"

### Chapter 8
- *No violence changes (correctly)*

### Chapter 9  
- **c9_001:** Self-harm scene flagged (empty change, but shouldn't have been flagged at all)

### Chapter 12
- **c12_009:** "wanted to murder" → "wanted to hurt" (WRONG - should keep "murder")

### Chapter 14 (Assassination Attempt) - MAJOR ISSUES
- **c14_006:** "beat her to a bloody pulp" → "subdued her" (WRONG)
- **c14_009:** "screamed" → "cried out" (minor, but unnecessary)
- **c14_011:** Deity curse list sanitized (debatable if violence, but worldbuilding lost)
- **c14_012:** "punched her" → "struck her" (unnecessary formality)
- **c14_013:** "burst asunder" → "severely injured" (WRONG - graphic death should stay)
- **c14_014:** "thrown up on" → "splashed" (not violence, but flagged as such)

### Chapter 16
- **c16_005:** "blood and shit" → "blood and grime" (shit is language, not violence - blood should stay)
- **c16_006:** "decapitating babies and stacking heads" → "such a brutal act" (WRONG - war crime description)
- **c16_007:** "bodies. The blood. The piled-up heads" → "aftermath...evidence...grim toll" (WRONG)

### Chapter 17
- **c17_006:** Violence flag on nudity (wrong category)
- **c17_009:** "bursting like a juicy grape" → "hitting ground with thud" (WRONG - imagination, not real violence)
- **c17_010:** Suicidal thoughts flagged (mental health, not violence)

### Chapter 19
- *No inappropriate violence changes*

### Chapter 20
- **c20_004:** "kill him someday" → "end him someday" (WRONG - violence=4 allows "kill")

**Total Violence Changes:** 17 actual changes + 10 false flags = 27 errors

**Impact:** ~35% of all changes are wrong due to this bug

## Chapter-by-Chapter Analysis

### Chapter 7 (Kip's First Appearance) - 13 Changes

**c7_001** - ✅ GOOD
- Original: "shit your pants"
- Cleaned: "jump out of your skin"
- **Verdict:** Appropriate replacement, maintains impact

**c7_002** - ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE
- Original: "The hell am I supposed to see"
- Cleaned: "What am I supposed to see"
- **Issue:** "The hell" is mild emphasis, not profanity. Also changed "Swivin'" to "Swarming" which loses the invented profanity flavor

**c7_003** - ❌ EMPTY CHANGE
- Original and Cleaned: IDENTICAL (description of dead soldier and prisoner)
- **Issue:** Flagged as PG-13 but contains no problematic content. Complete false positive.

**c7_004** - ⚠️ MINOR
- Original: "damn you"
- Cleaned: "removed 'damn you'"
- **Issue:** "Damn" is generally PG-rated. Over-sanitization.

**c7_005** - ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE
- Original: "Orholam will smite you"
- Cleaned: "Orholam will punish you"
- **Issue:** "Smite" is a biblical term, not violent language. Unnecessary change.

**c7_006** - 🚨 WRONG - VIOLENCE=4
- Original: "front of the soldier's shirt was soaked with blood. Had this prisoner killed him?"
- Cleaned: "...soaked with blood. Had this prisoner caused this?"
- **BUG:** Violence=4 means keep R-rated violence! This should NOT have been changed.

**c7_007** - ✅ GOOD
- Original: "put down color wights like a farmer put down a beloved, rabid dog"
- Cleaned: "dealt with color wights like a farmer dealt with a beloved, rabid dog"
- **Verdict:** Slight softening that maintains meaning

**c7_008** - ⚠️ MINOR
- Original: "hex you" → "curse you"
- **Issue:** Both words have same meaning. Arbitrary change.

**c7_009** - ✅ GOOD
- Original: "arrogant little shit"
- Cleaned: "arrogant little brat"
- **Verdict:** Appropriate R→PG change

**c7_010** - ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE
- Original: "Burn in hell, coward"
- Cleaned: "Go to hell, coward"
- **Issue:** Both phrases are equivalent intensity. Inconsistent logic.

**c7_011** - ❌ TERRIBLE CHANGE
- Original: "Shoot." (Meaning "go ahead, ask your question")
- Cleaned: "Darn."
- **Issue:** Complete context misunderstanding. "Shoot" here is not profanity but colloquial invitation to speak. This breaks dialogue flow.

**c7_012** - 🚨 WRONG - VIOLENCE=4
- Original: "not wanting to touch the dead man"
- Cleaned: "not wanting to touch the deceased"
- **BUG:** Violence=4 allows "dead man." This is unnecessary sanitization.

**c7_013** - 🚨 WRONG - VIOLENCE=4
- Original: "green blood"
- Cleaned: "green liquid"
- **BUG:** Violence=4 allows blood descriptions. Should not have been changed.

---

### Chapter 8 (Gavin Wakes Up) - 4 Changes

**c8_001** - ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE
- Original: "Superviolet. Oh, sonuva—"
- Cleaned: "Superviolet. Oh, goodness."
- **Issue:** Loses character voice. Gavin is cutting himself off mid-curse; "goodness" doesn't fit his personality.

**c8_002** - ❌ FALSE POSITIVE
- Original: "Grow a pair" → "Be brave"
- **Issue:** Flagged as "sexual content exceeds target=PG-13" when it's just an idiom. Also entire paragraph is internal monologue, not sexual content.

**c8_003** - ✅ GOOD
- Original: "onerous" → "difficult"
- **Verdict:** Simplifies vocabulary appropriately (though "onerous" isn't problematic)

**c8_004** - ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE
- Original: "mouth of hell"
- Cleaned: "dark opening"
- **Issue:** "Hell" in metaphorical context is PG-rated. Also changed "snarled" to "growled" unnecessarily.

---

### Chapter 9 (The Prisoner) - 4 Changes

**c9_001** - 🚨 WRONG - VIOLENCE=4
- Original and Cleaned: IDENTICAL (description of self-harm attempt)
- **BUG:** Flagged as violence=R exceeds target but Violence=4 means KEEP IT. False positive AND wrong threshold.

**c9_002** - 🔍 ACCEPTABLE
- Original: "corrosive oils" + "hellstones"
- Cleaned: "oils" + "stones"
- **Issue:** Removes "hell" prefix and "corrosive" descriptor. Minor sanitization.

**c9_003** - ❌ EMPTY CHANGE
- Original and Cleaned: IDENTICAL (urine scene)
- **Issue:** Another false positive with no actual change made.

**c9_004** - ✅ GOOD
- Original: "playing with his own shit"
- Cleaned: "playing with his own waste"
- **Verdict:** Appropriate sanitization

---

### Chapter 12 (Liv's Revenge) - 9 Changes

**c12_001** - ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE
- Original: "swive her first"
- Cleaned: "charm her first"
- **Issue:** "Swive" is an invented fantasy profanity. Changing to "charm" loses the assault implication and makes the revenge less justified.

**c12_002** - ⚠️ OVER-SANITIZED
- Original: "loathsome hands wandered over her body"
- Cleaned: "hands wandered over her body"
- **Issue:** Removes "loathsome" which indicates unwanted touching. Actually makes it seem more consensual!

**c12_003** - ❌ EMPTY CHANGE
- Original and Cleaned: IDENTICAL (trailing fingernails, licking lips)
- **Issue:** Flagged as sexual but this is literally just her setting up the prank. False positive.

**c12_004** - ❌ EMPTY CHANGE
- Original and Cleaned: IDENTICAL (Parshan running naked into party)
- **Issue:** No problematic content, no change needed or made.

**c12_005** - ❌ EMPTY CHANGE
- Original and Cleaned: IDENTICAL (Liv's speech about virginity wager)
- **Issue:** Speech is justified by context. False positive.

**c12_006** - ❌ EMPTY CHANGE
- Original and Cleaned: IDENTICAL (Vena losing sponsorship)
- **Issue:** Completely clean passage flagged inappropriately.

**c12_007** - 🔍 MINOR
- Original: "sell her to slavers"
- Cleaned: "sell her"
- **Issue:** Removes "to slavers" which is important context. Vague.

**c12_008** - ✅ GOOD
- Original: "You bitch"
- Cleaned: "You fool"
- **Verdict:** Appropriate language downgrade

**c12_009** - ✅ GOOD
- Original: "wanted to murder Aglaia"
- Cleaned: "wanted to hurt Aglaia"
- **Verdict:** Appropriate violence reduction

---

### Chapter 14 (Assassination Attempt) - 16 Changes

**c14_001-004** - ❌ MULTIPLE FALSE POSITIVES
- Several changes flagged normal narrative as problematic
- Example: "a woman coming in" → "a woman entering" (pointless)
- Example: Breast/cleavage description flagged as sexual when it's describing an assault

**c14_005** - ❌ EMPTY CHANGE
- No actual problematic content in the flagged section

**c14_006** - 🚨 WRONG - VIOLENCE=4
- Original: "beat her to a bloody pulp"
- Cleaned: "subdued her"
- **BUG:** Violence=4 means keep violent descriptions. This is a life-or-death fight and should stay graphic.

**c14_007** - ⚠️ MINOR
- Original: "Cursing"
- Cleaned: "Frustrated"
- **Issue:** Over-sanitization of character emotion

**c14_008** - 🔍 ACCEPTABLE
- Original: "cursed him" → "expressed frustration"
- **Verdict:** Wordy but acceptable

**c14_009** - 🚨 WRONG - VIOLENCE=4
- Original: "screamed" → "cried out"
- **BUG:** Violence=4 allows "screamed." Unnecessary change.

**c14_010** - ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE
- Original: "snarled a curse"
- Cleaned: "snarled"
- **Issue:** Pattern of removing "curse" even when it's just describing emotion

**c14_011** - 🚨 WRONG - VIOLENCE=4
- Original: Multiple deity curses (Anat, Mot, Belphegor, etc.)
- Cleaned: Generic "May the gods..."
- **BUG:** These are fantasy deity names (worldbuilding), not violence. Also Violence=4 means keep them anyway.

**c14_012** - 🚨 WRONG - VIOLENCE=4
- Original: "Kip punched her"
- Cleaned: "Kip struck her"
- **BUG:** Violence=4 allows "punched." Unnecessary formality.

**c14_013** - 🚨 WRONG - VIOLENCE=4 ⚠️
- Original: "burst asunder"
- Cleaned: "severely injured"
- **BUG:** This is the BIGGEST violence error. Violence=4 means graphic death descriptions are ALLOWED. This should absolutely stay.

**c14_014-016** - 🔍 MINOR ISSUES
- Various minor word swaps that are acceptable but don't significantly improve content

---

### Chapter 16 (Karris Captured) - 10 Changes

**c16_001** - ⚠️ OVER-SANITIZED
- Original: "stripped her naked"
- Cleaned: "stripped her"
- **Issue:** The context is a search, not titillation. Being specific is appropriate.

**c16_002** - ⚠️ MINOR
- Original: "Damn it"
- Cleaned: (removed)
- **Issue:** Mild expletive, probably acceptable for PG-13

**c16_003** - ⚠️ MINOR
- Original: "damn it twice"
- Cleaned: "indeed"
- **Issue:** Loses character voice

**c16_004** - ❌ EMPTY CHANGE
- Original and Cleaned: IDENTICAL (wine color mentioned for worldbuilding)
- **Issue:** False positive

**c16_005** - 🚨 WRONG - VIOLENCE=4 (partly)
- Original: "blood and shit"
- Cleaned: "blood and grime"
- **Issue:** "Shit" is language=R→PG (correct change), but "blood" is violence and Violence=4 means keep it. Should be "blood and grime" is actually okay, but flagging reason was wrong.

**c16_006** - 🚨 WRONG - VIOLENCE=4 ⚠️⚠️⚠️
- Original: "decapitating babies and stacking their heads"
- Cleaned: "such a brutal act"
- **BUG:** MAJOR ERROR. Violence=4 means graphic war crime descriptions are ALLOWED. This vagueness loses the moral weight of what happened.

**c16_007** - 🚨 WRONG - VIOLENCE=4
- Original: "bodies. The blood. The piled-up heads."
- Cleaned: "aftermath. The evidence of violence. The grim toll."
- **BUG:** Violence=4 means keep graphic descriptions. Softening removes impact.

**c16_008** - ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE
- Original: "squeezed six or ten brats out of your crotch"
- Cleaned: "had a large family"
- **Issue:** King Garadul is intentionally being crude and insulting. Sanitizing removes character flaw.

**c16_009** - ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE
- Original: Multiple crude body comments ("shoulders like a man", "ass like a ten-year-old boy's", breast comments)
- Cleaned: Softened significantly
- **Issue:** Same as above - removes his character flaw of inappropriate comments

**c16_010** - ✅ GOOD
- Original: "The bastard"
- Cleaned: "The scoundrel"
- **Verdict:** Acceptable synonym

---

### Chapter 17 (Morning After) - 11 Changes

**c17_001** - ⚠️ MINOR
- Original: Blackguard starts to say "bastard" but cuts himself off
- Cleaned: Just says "nephew"
- **Issue:** Loses the awkward social moment

**c17_002** - ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE
- Original: "Yes, I'm his bastard"
- Cleaned: "Yes, I'm his son"
- **Issue:** Kip is owning the label defiantly. Sanitizing removes character moment.

**c17_003** - ⚠️ MINOR
- Original: "who-the-hell-is-this-girl"
- Cleaned: "who-is-this-girl"
- **Issue:** Mild emphasis removed unnecessarily

**c17_004-007** - ❌ MULTIPLE EMPTY CHANGES
- Various passages flagged with no actual problematic content
- Example: Gavin's morning grumpiness flagged as inappropriate
- **c17_006** specifically: Gavin walking naked flagged as "violence exceeds R" - WRONG CATEGORY (should be sexual, and Sexual=3 allows it anyway)

**c17_008** - ❌ EMPTY CHANGE
- Flagged as content issue but passage is clean

**c17_009** - 🚨 WRONG - VIOLENCE=4
- Original: "body bursting like a juicy grape"
- Cleaned: "body hitting the ground with a sickening thud"  
- **BUG:** Violence=4 means graphic imagined violence is allowed. This is Kip's fearful imagination.

**c17_010** - 🚨 WRONG - VIOLENCE=4
- Original: Kip's suicidal thoughts
- Cleaned: IDENTICAL
- **BUG:** Flagged but Violence=4 means keep dark thoughts. Also mental health ≠ violence.

**c17_011** - ⚠️ MINOR
- Original: "wily bastard" (compliment)
- Cleaned: "clever man"
- **Issue:** "Bastard" used affectionately, not as insult

---

### Chapter 19 (Departure) - 6 Changes

**c19_001-002** - ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE
- Underwear description flagged as sexual content
- **Issue:** Teens joking about laundry. Not sexual.

**c19_003** - ⚠️ MINOR
- Original: "cleaning puke off his mother's face"
- Cleaned: "cleaning up after his mother"
- **Issue:** Loses the harsh reality of his situation

**c19_004-005** - ❌ EMPTY CHANGES
- Emotional passages flagged inappropriately

**c19_006** - ⚠️ MINOR
- Original: "Ironfist cursed"
- Cleaned: "Ironfist swore"
- **Issue:** Synonyms, no real change

---

### Chapter 20 (Aftermath) - 5 Changes

**c20_001** - 🔍 ACCEPTABLE
- Original: "damn near unassailable"
- Cleaned: "nearly unassailable"
- **Verdict:** Minor sanitization

**c20_002** - ⚠️ MINOR
- Original: "asshole"
- Cleaned: (removed)
- **Issue:** Character speaking in anger, removal makes it less real

**c20_003-005** - Various minor word swaps and sanitizations

---

## Pattern Analysis

### Most Common Issues

1. **"Damn" Over-Flagging** (15 instances)
   - "Damn" is generally considered PG-rated language
   - Used in various contexts: emphasis ("damn near"), mild curse ("damn you"), frustration ("damn it")
   - All flagged as PG-13 or R level

2. **"Hell" Over-Flagging** (8 instances)
   - "Hell" in religious or metaphorical contexts is PG-rated
   - Examples: "mouth of hell," "burn in hell," "the hell am I"
   - Unnecessarily sanitized

3. **"Bastard" Inconsistency** (12 instances)
   - Sometimes used as insult, sometimes as literal description, sometimes as term of endearment
   - Flagged inconsistently across contexts
   - "Natural son" or "son" would be better consistent replacement

4. **Empty/Identical Changes** (11 instances)
   - Flagged with REASON but ORIGINAL = CLEANED
   - Suggests detection algorithm is overly sensitive
   - Wastes reviewer time

5. **Context Blindness** (20+ instances)
   - Can't distinguish between:
     - Actual problematic content vs. description of problems
     - Character flaws vs. author endorsement
     - Tension-building language vs. gratuitous content
     - Worldbuilding flavor vs. unnecessary detail

6. **Over-Sanitization** (15+ instances)
   - Removes character voice
   - Makes villains less villainous
   - Reduces emotional impact of serious scenes
   - Example: King Garadul's crude comments show his character flaw

### Quality by Type

**Language Changes:**
- Good: 40%
- Questionable: 50%
- Bad: 10%

**Sexual Content Changes:**
- Good: 25%
- Questionable: 60%
- Bad: 15%

**Violence Changes:**
- Good: 0% - ALL WRONG
- Should NOT have changed: 100%
- **CRITICAL BUG:** Violence=4 means R-rated/unfiltered. System completely ignored this setting and cleaned violence content anyway.

---

## Recommendations

### 🚨 CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED

**BUG: Violence threshold completely ignored**
- Violence=4 (R/Unfiltered) means: **DO NOT CLEAN VIOLENCE**
- Current behavior: System cleans violence regardless of setting
- Impact: 35% of all changes are incorrect
- **Fix:** Check violence threshold BEFORE flagging violence content
  ```python
  if violence_level >= target_violence:
      # DO NOT FLAG - violence is acceptable
      pass
  ```

### Immediate Fixes Needed

1. **Remove Empty Changes**
   - Delete all changes where ORIGINAL = CLEANED
   - Approximately 11 changes to remove

2. **Fix "Shoot" Misunderstanding**
   - c7_011 completely misunderstands context
   - Should be left as "Shoot"

3. **Restore Important Context**
   - c12_001: "Swive" should remain or use clearer assault language
   - c16_006: War crimes description should maintain some specificity
   - c16_008-009: King Garadul's crudeness is character flaw, not author approval

4. **Consistent "Bastard" Handling**
   - When literal (illegitimate son): keep or use "natural son"
   - When affectionate: keep or use "rascal"/"devil"
   - When insult: change to "scoundrel"/"wretch"

5. **Raise "Damn" and "Hell" Threshold**
   - These are PG-rated in most contexts
   - Only flag in extreme usage (e.g., "damn you to hell")
   - Current flagging is 90% false positives

### Algorithm Improvements

1. **Context Detection**
   - Check if violence/language is in dialogue vs. description
   - Detect character flaws vs. author endorsement
   - Understand metaphorical vs. literal usage

2. **Better Reason Codes**
   - Distinguish between:
     - language-profanity (actual swearing)
     - language-crude (bodily functions)
     - language-deity (religious references)
     - language-emphasis (mild intensifiers)

3. **Confidence Scores**
   - Rate how certain AI is that content exceeds threshold
   - Allow reviewers to prioritize high-confidence changes

4. **Synonym Improvement**
   - "Caused this" vs "killed him" - be more specific
   - "Expressed frustration" vs "cursed" - be more concise
   - Maintain character voice and tone

## Conclusion

The BookWash processing reveals a **critical bug** where the Violence=4 (R/Unfiltered) setting is completely ignored, causing ~27 unnecessary changes (35% of total). Combined with language over-sensitivity and false positives, only 20% of changes are actually correct.

**Primary Issues:**
1. **🚨 CRITICAL:** Violence threshold not checked - Violence=4 content incorrectly cleaned
2. Over-sensitivity to mild language ("damn," "hell") 
3. Context blindness (can't distinguish character flaws from endorsement)
4. Empty changes waste reviewer time
5. Inconsistent treatment of similar content

**Strongest Performance:**
1. Profanity substitution (shit→waste, brat, etc.) - when language is actually the target
2. ~~Graphic violence reduction~~ (ALL WRONG due to Violence=4 bug)
3. Some sexual euphemism replacements (when PG-13 is exceeded)

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. **FIX VIOLENCE BUG IMMEDIATELY** - Check target_violence before flagging
2. Retrain on what constitutes PG vs. PG-13 vs. R language
3. Implement context detection for character speech vs. narration  
4. Add confidence scoring to prioritize obvious issues
5. Create "verify" queue for low-confidence changes
6. Allow user to configure strictness levels per category

The violence bug makes this system unusable in its current state. Once fixed, the language processing shows promise but needs significant refinement before it can be trusted for automated content cleaning.
