Analyze the following text and rate it for content.

Categories:

1. LANGUAGE
   No language filtering requested - respond with NO.

2. SEXUAL CONTENT - Use MPAA film rating standards:
   - G: No romance. Content suitable for young children.
   - PG: Light romance (hand-holding, quick innocent kiss). Nothing that would make a parent uncomfortable.
   - PG-13: Passionate kissing, implied intimacy, fade-to-black. The camera cuts away before anything explicit.
   - R: Sexual content that would get a film an R rating. Descriptive intimate scenes, even if poetic/metaphorical.
   - X: Explicit, graphic sexual content.

   CRITICAL: Authors often describe sex through metaphor, poetry, or fragmented prose.
   If it's clearly describing sex artistically → rate it R.
   Poetic language does not reduce the rating.

3. VIOLENCE - Use MPAA film rating standards:
   - G: No physical violence (arguments only)
   - PG: Mild action, brief scuffles, no blood
   - PG-13: Combat, injuries, some blood, weapon use
   - R: Graphic injury detail, notable gore, intense violence
   - X: Extreme gore/torture, sadistic detail

4. DESCRIPTION: Provide a 2-3 sentence summary of what happens in this chapter.
   Focus on plot events and character interactions. This will help provide context for content editing.

Respond in EXACTLY this format (one rating per line):
LANGUAGE: NO
SEXUAL: [G, PG, PG-13, R, or X]
VIOLENCE: [G, PG, PG-13, R, or X]
DESCRIPTION: [2-3 sentence summary of chapter events]

ADULT CLEANING PROMPT

============================================================

You are cleaning romantic/sensual content to achieve a PG rating.
[CONTEXT FOR REFERENCE - DO NOT INCLUDE IN OUTPUT]
Chapter: The narrator and four companions encounter Felurian, a naked, singing faerie by a pool. While some of the companions are fearful and resist her allure, the narrator, inspired by her song and a memory of a woman, decides to enter the clearing. The narrator declares they will meet their companions in three days and steps into the clearing to approach Felurian.

Think like an MPAA movie rating board. Your job is to edit this text so it would fit in a PG-rated film.

THE QUESTION: If this scene were in a movie, would it get a PG rating or higher?
- If it would get PG or lower → KEEP IT
- If it would get a higher rating → REMOVE or REWRITE IT

CLEANING APPROACH:
- Remove content that exceeds the PG threshold
- You may replace explicit scenes with brief neutral summaries ("They spent time together.")
- You may use "fade to black" transitions ("Later that evening...")
- When in doubt about whether something is PG-appropriate, remove it

REMEMBER: Poetic or metaphorical descriptions of sex are still descriptions of sex. 
A beautifully written sex scene is still a sex scene - clean it accordingly.

RULES:
1. Return ONLY the cleaned text - no explanations
2. Preserve paragraph structure - keep the same number of paragraphs, separated by blank lines
3. DO NOT ADD [B], [I], or any formatting tags that are not in the original text!
4. DO NOT ADD chapter numbers, "Chapter X", or any headers that aren't in the original text
5. When uncertain, remove it

AGGRESSIVE ADULT CLEANING PROMPT

============================================================

⚠️ AGGRESSIVE CLEANING MODE - This content FAILED normal cleaning. Be EXTREMELY strict.

Your job is to COMPLETELY REMOVE all sexual/sensual content and replace with brief summaries.

🚨 CRITICAL: YOUR OUTPUT MUST BE DIFFERENT FROM THE INPUT 🚨
This text was already sent for cleaning and came back unchanged. That was WRONG.
You MUST modify this text. Returning it unchanged is NOT acceptable.

AGGRESSIVE RULES:
1. ANY description of bodies, touching, kissing, or physical intimacy → REMOVE entirely
2. ANY suggestive dialogue or innuendo → REMOVE entirely  
3. Replace removed content with a brief summary of what happened
4. When in doubt → REMOVE IT. Better to lose content than keep anything questionable.
5. This should be safe for a 10-year-old to read.
6. DO NOT ADD chapter numbers, "Chapter X", or any headers that aren't in the original text.
7. MATCH the narrative voice of the input. If the input uses "I", your output uses "I".

SPECIFIC PHRASES THAT MUST BE REMOVED (examples):
- "clutch her hips" → sexual, REMOVE
- "our rhythm" → sexual metaphor, REMOVE  
- "she writhes" → sexual, REMOVE
- "astride me" → sexual position, REMOVE
- "her motion slows" (in sexual context) → REMOVE
- Any mention of bodies moving together rhythmically → REMOVE

DO NOT try to preserve the scene's mood or tension. Just summarize what happened plot-wise.
If the input is describing a sex scene, your output should be 1-2 sentences like "They were together."

RULES:
1. Return ONLY the cleaned text - no explanations
2. It's OK to drastically shorten the text
3. DO NOT ADD [B], [I], or any formatting tags
