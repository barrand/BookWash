Analyze the following text and rate it for content.

Categories:

1. LANGUAGE (profanity, offensive words)
   The user wants to detect these specific words: bummer, damn, hell, crap, ass, piss, shit, bitch, bastard, asshole, bullshit, fuck, motherfucker, goddamn, jesus christ, oh my god
   
   Look for these words OR any similarly offensive profanity/slurs:
   - Include variations: shit → sh*t, shite, shitty
   - Include misspellings: fuck → fuk, fuuck
   - Include compounds: bullshit, motherfucker, goddamn
   - Include similar severity: if 'bitch' is listed, also detect 'slut', 'son of a bitch'
   
   ⚠️ EXCEPTION - LEGITIMATE/PROPER USES (do NOT flag these):
   - "bastard" meaning illegitimate child - NEVER FLAG when referring to illegitimate birth:
     • "born a bastard", "the king's bastard", "his bastard", "[name]'s bastard", "fathered a bastard"
     • "I'm a bastard", "I'm his bastard", "You're a bastard" (when discussing parentage)
     • "the bastard son", "a bastard child", "Gavin's bastard", "Kip was Gavin's bastard"
     • Context clue: if discussing parentage, lineage, birth status, or social shame of illegitimacy → DO NOT FLAG
   - "bitch" meaning female dog (e.g., "the bitch and her puppies", "a hunting bitch")
   - "ass" meaning donkey (e.g., "rode an ass", "stubborn as an ass")
   - "damn" meaning to condemn (e.g., "damn his soul", "damned to hell" in religious context), or physical construction for retaining water (e.g., "the damn held back the river")
   - "hell" as a place (e.g., "descended into hell", "the fires of hell")
   - "prick" meaning to pierce (e.g., "pricked her finger", "prick of a needle")
   - "cock" meaning rooster (e.g., "the cock crowed", "cockfight")
   
   Only flag words used as profanity, insults, or crude slang - NOT their literal meanings.
   
   Respond with YES if ANY profane uses are found, NO if the text is clean.

2. SEXUAL CONTENT - Use MPAA film rating standards:
   - G: No romance. Content suitable for young children.
   - PG: Light romance (hand-holding, quick innocent kiss). Nothing that would make a parent uncomfortable.
   - PG-13: Passionate kissing, implied intimacy, fade-to-black. The camera cuts away before anything explicit.
   - R: Sexual content that would get a film an R rating. Descriptive intimate scenes, even if poetic/metaphorical.
   - X: Explicit, graphic sexual content.

   CRITICAL: Authors often describe sex through metaphor, poetry, or fragmented prose.
   If it's clearly describing sex artistically → rate it R.
   Poetic language does not reduce the rating.

3. VIOLENCE - Use MPAA film rating standards:
   - G: No physical violence (arguments only)
   - PG: Mild action, brief scuffles, no blood
   - PG-13: Combat, injuries, some blood, weapon use
   - R: Graphic injury detail, notable gore, intense violence
   - X: Extreme gore/torture, sadistic detail

4. DESCRIPTION: Provide a 2-3 sentence summary of what happens in this chapter.
   Focus on plot events and character interactions. This will help provide context for content editing.

Respond in EXACTLY this format (one rating per line):
LANGUAGE: [YES or NO]
SEXUAL: [G, PG, PG-13, R, or X]
VIOLENCE: [G, PG, PG-13, R, or X]
DESCRIPTION: [2-3 sentence summary of chapter events]

LANGUAGE CLEANING PROMPT
Logged: 01/04/26 12:43am MT
============================================================

You are cleaning offensive language from a book. Your task is to replace specific words and slurs in a natural way that meets the narrative of the chapter while erring on the side of removing offensive content.
[CONTEXT FOR REFERENCE - DO NOT INCLUDE IN OUTPUT]
Chapter: The narrator and his companions are drawn to a clearing by the singing of a naked woman named Felurian. While some of the companions are fearful and resist, the narrator, inspired by his identity and a sense of opportunity, decides to enter the clearing. He is captivated by Felurian's beauty and the magical pull of her song.
[END CONTEXT]


SPECIFIC WORDS TO REMOVE: bummer, damn, hell, crap, ass, piss, shit, bitch, bastard, asshole, bullshit, fuck, motherfucker, goddamn, jesus christ, oh my god

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Return the COMPLETE cleaned text - ALL paragraphs, and the changed sections
2. Preserve ALL whitespace EXACTLY - same line breaks in the same positions. If a line break occurs mid-sentence, keep it there.
3. DO NOT change anything else - keep all other content identical
4. Narrative descriptions like "he cursed" or "she swore" are ALLOWED - only remove actual offensive words
5. You are doing LANGUAGE CLEANING only - never delete paragraphs or sentences (except profane words within them)

⚠️ FORMATTING TAGS - CRITICAL ⚠️
5. DO NOT ADD [B], [I], or any formatting tags that are not in the original text!
   - If the original word has NO tags around it, the replacement must have NO tags
   - WRONG: "hell" → "[B]heck[/B]" (added tags that weren't there!)
   - CORRECT: "hell" → "heck" (no tags added)
   - WRONG: "son of a bitch" → "[B]scoundrel[/B]" (added tags!)
   - CORRECT: "son of a bitch" → "scoundrel" (no tags)
   - Only PRESERVE existing tags: "[I]damn[/I]" → "[I]darn[/I]" (kept existing tags)

SENTENCE REPAIR (VERY IMPORTANT):
- NEVER leave a sentence starting with just "It," or "This," - that is broken grammar
- If a profane word starts a sentence like "Fuck this" or "Fuck it", you MUST rewrite the ENTIRE sentence
- Examples of BROKEN output to AVOID:
  - "It," he muttered  ← WRONG
  - "This," he screamed ← WRONG
- Correct rewrites:
  - "Fuck it" → "Whatever" or "Forget it" or "I don't care" or remove the sentence
  - "Fuck this" → "I'm done with this" or "This is pointless" or remove
  - "Fuck everything" → "I hate everything" or "Everything is terrible" or remove

REPLACEMENT GUIDANCE:

SEVERE PROFANITY (fuck, motherfucker, cunt):
   - Remove entirely OR rephrase the sentence to convey emotion without the word
   - "What the fuck?" → "What?" or "What is going on?"
   - "Fuck you!" → Remove the line, or "Get away from me!"
   - "fucking idiot" → "complete idiot" or just "idiot"
   - "motherfucker" → Remove entirely

STRONG PROFANITY (shit, bitch, bastard, asshole, bullshit):
   - "shit" → "crud" or remove ("Oh shit!" → "Oh no!")
   - "bullshit" → "nonsense" or "ridiculous"
   - "bitch" → "jerk", "idiot", "sissy" or remove
   - "bastard" → "jerk" or "scoundrel"
   - "asshole" → "jerk", "fool", "dork" or remove
   - "son of a bitch" → remove entirely

MODERATE PROFANITY (damn, hell, crap, ass):
   - "damn" → "curses" or remove ("Damn it!" → "Darn it!" or just remove)
   - "hell" → rephrase ("What the hell" → "What on earth")
   - "crap" → "crud" or "junk"
   - "ass" → "butt" or "rear" or remove

BLASPHEMOUS EXPRESSIONS (goddamn, jesus christ as expletive, oh my god):
   - "goddamn" → "goodness" or remove
   - "Jesus Christ!" (as expletive) → "Good grief!" or remove
   - "Oh my god!" (as expletive) → "Oh my!" or "Oh my goodness!"
   - Keep genuine religious usage (prayer, worship) unchanged

GENERAL PRINCIPLES:
- Preserve the emotional intensity when possible
- If a word is used for emphasis, the replacement should carry similar weight
- When removing a word leaves awkward phrasing, REWRITE the sentence to be grammatically correct
- Don't add new ideas, but DO fix broken grammar caused by word removal

Think like an MPAA movie rating board. Your job is to edit this text so it would fit in a PG-rated film.

THE QUESTION: If this scene were in a movie, would it get a PG rating or higher?
- If it would get PG or lower → KEEP IT
- If it would get a higher rating → REMOVE or REWRITE IT

CLEANING APPROACH:
- Remove content that exceeds the PG threshold
- You may replace explicit scenes with brief neutral summaries ("They spent time together.")
- You may use "fade to black" transitions ("Later that evening...")
- When in doubt about whether something is PG-appropriate, remove it

REMEMBER: Poetic or metaphorical descriptions of sex are still descriptions of sex. 
A beautifully written sex scene is still a sex scene - clean it accordingly.

RULES:
1. Return ONLY the cleaned text - no explanations
2. Preserve paragraph structure - keep the same number of paragraphs, separated by blank lines
3. DO NOT ADD [B], [I], or any formatting tags that are not in the original text!
4. DO NOT ADD chapter numbers, "Chapter X", or any headers that aren't in the original text
5. When uncertain, remove it

AGGRESSIVE ADULT CLEANING PROMPT

============================================================

⚠️ AGGRESSIVE CLEANING MODE - This content FAILED normal cleaning. Be EXTREMELY strict.

Your job is to COMPLETELY REMOVE all sexual/sensual content and replace with brief summaries.

🚨 CRITICAL: YOUR OUTPUT MUST BE DIFFERENT FROM THE INPUT 🚨
This text was already sent for cleaning and came back unchanged. That was WRONG.
You MUST modify this text. Returning it unchanged is NOT acceptable.

AGGRESSIVE RULES:
1. ANY description of bodies, touching, kissing, or physical intimacy → REMOVE entirely
2. ANY suggestive dialogue or innuendo → REMOVE entirely  
3. Replace removed content with a brief summary of what happened
4. When in doubt → REMOVE IT. Better to lose content than keep anything questionable.
5. This should be safe for a 10-year-old to read.
6. DO NOT ADD chapter numbers, "Chapter X", or any headers that aren't in the original text.
7. MATCH the narrative voice of the input. If the input uses "I", your output uses "I".

SPECIFIC PHRASES THAT MUST BE REMOVED (examples):
- "clutch her hips" → sexual, REMOVE
- "our rhythm" → sexual metaphor, REMOVE  
- "she writhes" → sexual, REMOVE
- "astride me" → sexual position, REMOVE
- "her motion slows" (in sexual context) → REMOVE
- Any mention of bodies moving together rhythmically → REMOVE

DO NOT try to preserve the scene's mood or tension. Just summarize what happened plot-wise.
If the input is describing a sex scene, your output should be 1-2 sentences like "They were together."

RULES:
1. Return ONLY the cleaned text - no explanations
2. It's OK to drastically shorten the text
3. DO NOT ADD [B], [I], or any formatting tags
