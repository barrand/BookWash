Analyze the following text and rate it for content.

Categories:

1. LANGUAGE (profanity, offensive words)
   The user wants to detect these specific words: bummer, damn, hell, crap, ass, piss, shit, bitch, bastard, asshole, bullshit, fuck, motherfucker, goddamn, jesus christ, oh my god
   
   Look for these words OR any similarly offensive profanity/slurs:
   - Include variations: shit → sh*t, shite, shitty
   - Include misspellings: fuck → fuk, fuuck
   - Include compounds: bullshit, motherfucker, goddamn
   - Include similar severity: if 'bitch' is listed, also detect 'slut', 'son of a bitch'
   
   ⚠️ EXCEPTION - LEGITIMATE/PROPER USES (do NOT flag these):
   - "bastard" meaning illegitimate child - NEVER FLAG when referring to illegitimate birth:
     • "born a bastard", "the king's bastard", "his bastard", "[name]'s bastard", "fathered a bastard"
     • "I'm a bastard", "I'm his bastard", "You're a bastard" (when discussing parentage)
     • "the bastard son", "a bastard child", "Gavin's bastard", "Kip was Gavin's bastard"
     • Context clue: if discussing parentage, lineage, birth status, or social shame of illegitimacy → DO NOT FLAG
   - "bitch" meaning female dog (e.g., "the bitch and her puppies", "a hunting bitch")
   - "ass" meaning donkey (e.g., "rode an ass", "stubborn as an ass")
   - "damn" meaning to condemn (e.g., "damn his soul", "damned to hell" in religious context), or physical construction for retaining water (e.g., "the damn held back the river")
   - "hell" as a place (e.g., "descended into hell", "the fires of hell")
   - "prick" meaning to pierce (e.g., "pricked her finger", "prick of a needle")
   - "cock" meaning rooster (e.g., "the cock crowed", "cockfight")
   
   Only flag words used as profanity, insults, or crude slang - NOT their literal meanings.
   
   Respond with YES if ANY profane uses are found, NO if the text is clean.

2. SEXUAL CONTENT - Use MPAA film rating standards:
   - G: No romance. Content suitable for young children.
   - PG: Light romance (hand-holding, quick innocent kiss). Nothing that would make a parent uncomfortable.
   - PG-13: Passionate kissing, implied intimacy, fade-to-black. The camera cuts away before anything explicit.
   - R: Sexual content that would get a film an R rating. Descriptive intimate scenes, even if poetic/metaphorical.
   - X: Explicit, graphic sexual content.

   CRITICAL: Authors often describe sex through metaphor, poetry, or fragmented prose.
   If it's clearly describing sex artistically → rate it R.
   Poetic language does not reduce the rating.

3. VIOLENCE - Use MPAA film rating standards:
   - G: No physical violence (arguments only)
   - PG: Mild action, brief scuffles, no blood
   - PG-13: Combat, injuries, some blood, weapon use
   - R: Graphic injury detail, notable gore, intense violence
   - X: Extreme gore/torture, sadistic detail

4. DESCRIPTION: Provide a 2-3 sentence summary of what happens in this chapter.
   Focus on plot events and character interactions. This will help provide context for content editing.

Respond in EXACTLY this format (one rating per line):
LANGUAGE: [YES or NO]
SEXUAL: [G, PG, PG-13, R, or X]
VIOLENCE: [G, PG, PG-13, R, or X]
DESCRIPTION: [2-3 sentence summary of chapter events]

CHUNK IDENTIFICATION PROMPT

============================================================

Analyze each numbered paragraph and identify which ones contain content that exceeds the target ratings.

⚠️ CRITICAL: When in doubt, FLAG IT. It is much better to flag a paragraph that might be fine than to miss one that needs cleaning. False positives are acceptable; false negatives are not.

RATING SCALE DEFINITIONS:

LANGUAGE CONTENT DETECTION:
The user wants to filter these specific words: bummer, damn, hell, crap, ass, piss, shit, bitch, bastard, asshole, bullshit, fuck, motherfucker, goddamn, jesus christ, oh my god
Flag any paragraph containing these words OR any similarly offensive profanity/slurs.

Include variations, misspellings, and words of similar offensiveness level.
For example, if 'shit' is listed, also flag 'sh*t', 'shite', 'crap', etc.

SEXUAL CONTENT - Use MPAA film rating standards:
- G: No romance. Content suitable for young children.
- PG: Light romance (hand-holding, quick innocent kiss). Nothing that would make a parent uncomfortable.
- PG-13: Passionate kissing, implied intimacy, fade-to-black. The camera cuts away before anything explicit.
- R: Sexual content that would get a film an R rating. Descriptive intimate scenes, even if poetic/metaphorical.
- NC-17/X: Explicit, graphic sexual content.

CRITICAL: Authors often describe sex through metaphor, poetry, or fragmented prose rather than explicit terms. 
If you're reading a scene and thinking "this is clearly describing sex, just artistically" → rate it R.
Poetic language does not reduce the rating. A sex scene written beautifully is still a sex scene.

VIOLENCE:
- G: No physical violence (arguments only)
- PG: Mild action, non-detailed scuffles, no blood
- PG-13: Combat, injuries, some blood, weapon use without gore detail
- R: Graphic injury detail, notable gore, intense sustained violence
- X: Extreme gore/torture, sadistic detail

TARGET RATINGS (content must be at or BELOW these levels):
- Language: (based on word list above)
- Sexual: PG
- Violence: PG

IMPORTANT: Words like "shit", "bullshit", "fuck", "fucking" are R-level!

For each paragraph that EXCEEDS any target rating, list its number.
If a paragraph is acceptable, do NOT list it.

Respond with ONLY the paragraph numbers that need cleaning (one per line), or "NONE" if all paragraphs are acceptable.

Example response:
1
3
